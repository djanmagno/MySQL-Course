select o.order_id, o.product_id, p.name, o.quantity, o.unit_price 
from products as p
inner join order_items as o
	on p.product_id = o.product_id;

-- Selecting and Joining tables from different databases
use sql_inventory;

select *
from sql_store.order_items as oi
inner join products as p
	on oi.product_id = p.product_id;

-- A table can join with itself (SELF JOIN)
use sql_hr;

    pm.name 
from payments as p
inner join clients as c
	on p.client_id = c.client_id

-- Join two tables related by a composite columns primary key or foreign key
# Multiple conditions to join two tables
use sql_store;
select *
from order_items as oi
inner join order_item_notes as oin
	on oi.order_id = oin.order_id
    and oi.product_id = oin.product_id;

-- Exercise 12 - Outter Join the tables products and order items tables from sql_store database
select 
	p.product_id,
    p.name,
    oi.quantity
from products as p
left outer join order_items as oi
	on p.product_id = oi.product_id;
    
-- Exercise 13 - Outter Join of multiple tables customers,orders and shippers tables from sql_store database
select 
	o.order_date,
    o.order_id,
    c.first_name,
    s.name as 'shipper',

-- Exercise 14 - USING clause with join on sql_invoicing database
use sql_invoicing;

from payments as p
inner join clients as c
	using(client_id)
inner join payment_methods as pm
	on p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id;

-- NATURA JOIN clause join tables based in common columns
-- CROSS JOIN clause is used to combine every record from one table with every record of a second table

-- Exercise 15.1 - Use the Implicit CROSS JOIN method with the tables shippers and producs on sql_store database
use sql_store;
select 
	s.name as 'shipper',
    p.name as 'product'
from shippers as s, products as p
order by s.name;
-- Exercise 15.2 - Use the Explicit CROSS JOIN method with the tables shippers and producs on sql_store database
select 
	s.name as 'shipper',
    p.name as 'product'
from shippers as s
cross join products as p
order by s.name;

-- Exercise 16 - Use the union cluase to classify the number of points of each client in bronze, silber and gold
select 
	customer_id,
    first_name,
	points,
    'Bronze' as 'type'
from customers
where points < 2000
union
select 
	customer_id,
    first_name,
    points,
    'Silver' as 'type'
from customers
where points between 2000 and 3000
union
select 
	customer_id,
    first_name,
    points,
    'Gold' as 'type'
from customers
where points >= 3000
order by first_name;

-- Exercise 17 - Insert three rows in the products table
insert into products
values  (default, 'candy', 10000, 0.02),
		(default, 'notebook', 300, 5.59),
        (default, 'paper', 200000, 0.99);
select * from products;

-- Inserting Hierarchical Rows 
insert into orders (customer_id, order_date, status)
values (1, '2019-01-02', 1);

select last_insert_id();

insert into order_items
values
	(last_insert_id(), 2, 1, 2.95),
    (last_insert_id(), 3, 1, 4.95);
    
select * from order_items;

-- Exercise 18 - Create a copy of invoice table where it is possible to see the name of the clients and there is no null payment_date
use sql_invoicing;

create table invoice_archive
select
	i.invoice_id,
    i.number,
	c.name,
    i.invoice_total,
    i.payment_total,
    i.invoice_date,
    i.due_date,
    i.payment_date
from invoices as i
inner join clients as c
using(client_id)
where payment_date is not null;

select * from invoice_archive;

-- Exercise 19 - Write a SQL statement to give any customer born before 1990 50 extra points
use sql_store;

update customers
set 
	points = points + 50
where birth_date < '1990-01-01';

-- Exercise 20 - Update the comments in the order table for the customers with more than 3000 points
update orders
set 
	comments = 'Gold customer'
where customer_id in 
	(select customer_id
	from customers
	where points > 3000);
